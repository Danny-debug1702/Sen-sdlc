Student Name: Osiughwu Daniel Oghenetega
Matric No: 24/14364
Course Code: SEN 201
Course Title: Software Engineering
Lecturer: Prof. Aregbeshola
Institution: Caleb University

1.	Introduction
The Student Grade Calculator is a simple software application developed to calculate a student’s total score, average score, and final grade based on scores entered for selected subjects.
This project was developed as part of the SEN 201 assignment to demonstrate practical understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and basic programming concepts using Python.
2.	Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
To collect student academic scores
To compute the total and average scores
To determine the student’s grade automatically
To display student results accurately and clearly
3.	Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
Requirement Analysis
The Student Grade Calculator is designed to assist students or teachers in calculating academic results efficiently.
Functional Requirements:
Accept student name
Accept scores for three subjects
Calculate total score
Calculate average score
Display student grade
Non-Functional Requirements:
The system should be easy to use
The system should be accurate
The system should run using Python
System Components:
Input: Student name and subject scores
Processing: Calculation of total, average, and grade
Output: Student result details
Grading System Design:
70 – 100 → A
60 – 69 → B
50 – 59 → C
45 – 49 → D
Below 45 → F
Implementation
The Student Grade Calculator was implemented using Python.
Variables store student data and scores
Arithmetic operations compute total and average
Conditional statements determine the grade
The program runs through the command line
 Testing
Testing was conducted using various input values to ensure correct calculations and grading.
Test Cases:
Valid scores within range
Boundary values such as 69, 70, 49, and 50
Multiple input attempts
All test cases produced correct and expected results.
Deployment
The application was deployed by:
Saving the program as student_grade_calculator.py
Uploading the project files to a GitHub repository
4.	Conclusion
The Student Grade Calculator successfully demonstrates the application of the Software Development Life Cycle in developing a simple software system. The project meets all stated requirements and provides accurate grade calculations.
5.	GitHub Repository
The project source code is available on GitHub and contains:
Python source file
